cd uberto-checador
npm install
npm run babelify
node app
```

And that's it. Its running on localhost.

# Structure  

Everything is on `app`.  
Before running this stuff on production you have to compile (from `src`) the project running the comand `npm run babelify`.  
It generates all the compiled files to `public`.  
And that's it.
